# My personal dotfiles
Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Install 
To install dotfiles:
```bash 
$ make install
```
Symbolic links will be created under your home directory.

For macos defaults, you must execute manually:
```bash
$ bash macos/set-defaults.sh
```

## What's inside
There's a few special files in this repo.
- **bash config**
- **git config**
- **macos/set-defaults.sh**
